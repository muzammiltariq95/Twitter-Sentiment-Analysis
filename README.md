Sentiment Analysis Project

## Objective
Perform sentiment analysis on Borderlands-related text data to classify the sentiment of each entry. Draw inferences from the classification results.

## Data Description
The dataset contains text data related to the game Borderlands, along with sentiment labels. The goal is to classify the sentiment of each text entry as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

### Columns

## Steps to Perform Sentiment Analysis
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the text data by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text data into numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Train various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine) on the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model parameters to improve performance.
6. **Analyze Results**: Draw inferences from the classification results and interpret the model's predictions.

## Inferences
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of sentiments across the dataset.
- **Key Phrases**: Identify key phrases or words that are strongly associated with each sentiment category.
- **Model Performance**: Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.
